NAME
    Regexp::Wildcards - Converts wildcards to regexps.

VERSION
    Version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
        use Regexp::Wildcards qw/wc2re/;

        my $re;
        $re = wc2re 'a{b.,c}*' => 'unix';
        $re = wc2re 'a.,b*'    => 'win32';

DESCRIPTION
    This module converts wildcards expressions to Perl regular expressions.
    It handles the "*" and "?" jokers, as well as Unix bracketed
    alternatives "{,}", and uses the backspace ("\") as an escape character.
    Wrappers are provided to mimic the behaviour of Windows and Unix shells.

EXPORT
    Four functions are exported only on request : "wc2re", "wc2re_unix",
    "wc2re_win32" and "wc2re_jokers".

FUNCTIONS
  "wc2re_unix"
    This function takes as its only argument the wildcard string to process,
    and returns the corresponding regular expression (or "undef" if the
    source is invalid) according to standard Unix wildcard rules. It
    successively escapes all regexp special characters that doesn't hold any
    meaning for wildcards, turns jokers into their regexp equivalents, and
    changes bracketed blocks into alternations. If brackets are unbalanced,
    it will try to substitute as many of them as possible, and then escape
    the remaining "{" and "}".

  "wc2re_win32"
    Similar to the precedent, but for Windows wildcards. Bracketed blocks
    are no longer handled (which means that brackets will be escaped), but
    you can still provide a comma-separated list of items.

  "wc2re_jokers"
    This one only handles the "?" and "*" jokers.

  "wc2re"
    A generic function that wraps around all the different rules. The first
    argument is the wildcard expression, and the second one is the type of
    rules to apply, currently either "unix", "win32" or "jokers". If the
    type is undefined, it defaults to "unix".

SEE ALSO
    Net::FTPServer has a method for that. Only jokers are translated, and
    escaping won't preserve them.

    File::Find::Match::Util has a "wildcar" function that compiles a
    matcher. Only handles "*".

    Text::Buffer has the "convertWildcardToRegex" class method that handles
    jokers.
