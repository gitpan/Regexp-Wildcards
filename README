NAME
    Regexp::Wildcards - Converts wildcard expressions to Perl regular
    expressions.

VERSION
    Version 1.00

SYNOPSIS
        use Regexp::Wildcards;

        my $rw = Regexp::Wildcards->new(type => 'unix');

        my $re;
        $re = $rw->convert('a{b?,c}*');          # Do it Unix shell style.
        $re = $rw->convert('a?,b*',   'win32');  # Do it Windows shell style.
        $re = $rw->convert('*{x,y}?', 'jokers'); # Process the jokers and escape the rest.
        $re = $rw->convert('%a_c%',   'sql');   # Turn SQL wildcards into regexps.

        $rw = Regexp::Wildcards->new(
         do      => [ qw/jokers brackets/ ], # Do jokers and brackets.
         capture => [ qw/any greedy/ ],      # Capture *'s greedily.
        );

        $rw->do(add => 'groups');            # Don't escape groups.
        $rw->capture(rem => [ qw/greedy/ ]); # Actually we want non-greedy matches.
        $re = $rw->convert('*a{,(b)?}?c*');  # '(.*?)a(?:|(b).).c(.*?)'
        $rw->capture();                      # No more captures.

DESCRIPTION
    In many situations, users may want to specify patterns to match but
    don't need the full power of regexps. Wildcards make one of those sets
    of simplified rules. This module converts wildcard expressions to Perl
    regular expressions, so that you can use them for matching.

    It handles the "*" and "?" jokers, as well as Unix bracketed
    alternatives "{,}", but also "%" and "_" SQL wildcards. It can also keep
    original "(...)" groups. Backspace ("\") is used as an escape character.

    Typesets that mimic the behaviour of Windows and Unix shells are also
    provided.

METHODS
  "new [ do => $what | type => $type ], capture => $captures"
    Constructs a new Regexp::Wildcard object.

    "do" lists all features that should be enabled when converting wildcards
    to regexps. Refer to "do" for details on what can be passed in $what.

    The "type" specifies a predefined set of "do" features to use. See
    "type" for details on which types are valid. The "do" option overrides
    "type".

    "capture" lists which atoms should be capturing. Refer to "capture" for
    more details.

  "do [ $what | set => $c1, add => $c2, rem => $c3 ]"
    Specifies the list of metacharacters to convert. They are classified
    into five classes :

    'jokers' converts "?" to "." and "*" to ".*" ;
            'a**\\*b??\\?c' ==> 'a.*\\*b..\\?c'

    'sql' converts "_" to "." and "%" to ".*" ;
            'a%%\\%b__\\_c' ==> 'a.*\\%b..\\_c'

    'commas' converts all "," to "|" and puts the complete resulting regular
    expression inside "(?: ... )" ;
            'a,b{c,d},e' ==> '(?:a|b\\{c|d\\}|e)'

    'brackets' converts all matching "{ ... , ... }" brackets to "(?: ... |
    ... )" alternations. If some brackets are unbalanced, it tries to
    substitute as many of them as possible, and then escape the remaining
    unmatched "{" and "}". Commas outside of any bracket-delimited block are
    also escaped ;
            'a,b{c,d},e'    ==> 'a\\,b(?:c|d)\\,e'
            '{a\\{b,c}d,e}' ==> '(?:a\\{b|c)d\\,e\\}'
            '{a{b,c\\}d,e}' ==> '\\{a\\{b\\,c\\}d\\,e\\}'

    'groups' keeps the parenthesis "( ... )" of the original string without
    escaping them. Currently, no check is done to ensure that the
    parenthesis are matching.
            'a(b(c))d\\(\\)' ==> (no change)

    Each $c can be any of :

    A hash reference, with wanted metacharacter group names (described
    above) as keys and booleans as values ;
    An array reference containing the list of wanted metacharacter classes ;
    A plain scalar, when only one group is required.

    When "set" is present, the classes given as its value replace the
    current object options. Then the "add" classes are added, and the "rem"
    classes removed.

    Passing a sole scalar $what is equivalent as passing "set => $what". No
    argument means "set => [ ]".

        $rw->do(set => 'jokers');           # Only translate jokers.
        $rw->do('jokers');                  # Same.
        $rw->do(add => [ qw/sql commas/ ]); # Translate also SQL and commas.
        $rw->do(rem => 'jokers');           # Specifying both 'sql' and 'jokers' is useless.
        $rw->do();                          # Translate nothing.

  "type $type"
    Notifies to convert the metacharacters that corresponds to the
    predefined type $type. $type can be any of 'jokers', 'sql', 'commas',
    'brackets', 'win32' or 'unix'. An unknown or undefined value defaults to
    'unix', except for 'dos', 'os2', 'MSWin32' and 'cygwin' that default to
    'win32'. This means that you can pass $^O as the $type and get the
    corresponding shell behaviour. Returns the object.

        $rw->type('win32'); # Set type to win32.
        $rw->type();        # Set type to unix.

  "capture [ $captures | set => $c1, add => $c2, rem => $c3 ]"
    Specifies the list of atoms to capture. This method works like "do",
    except that the classes are different :

    'single' will capture all unescaped *"exactly one"* metacharacters, i.e.
    "?" for wildcards or "_" for SQL ;
            'a???b\\??' ==> 'a(.)(.)(.)b\\?(.)'
            'a___b\\__' ==> 'a(.)(.)(.)b\\_(.)'

    'any' will capture all unescaped *"any"* metacharacters, i.e. "*" for
    wildcards or "%" for SQL ;
            'a***b\\**' ==> 'a(.*)b\\*(.*)'
            'a%%%b\\%%' ==> 'a(.*)b\\%(.*)'

    'greedy', when used in conjunction with 'any', will make the 'any'
    captures greedy (by default they are not) ;
            'a***b\\**' ==> 'a(.*?)b\\*(.*?)'
            'a%%%b\\%%' ==> 'a(.*?)b\\%(.*?)'

    'brackets' will capture matching "{ ... , ... }" alternations.
            'a{b\\},\\{c}' ==> 'a(b\\}|\\{c)'

        $rw->capture(set => 'single');           # Only capture "exactly one" metacharacters.
        $rw->capture('single');                  # Same.
        $rw->capture(add => [ qw/any greedy/ ]); # Also greedily capture "any" metacharacters.
        $rw->capture(rem => 'greedy');           # No more greed please.
        $rw->capture();                          # Capture nothing.

  "convert $wc [ , $type ]"
    Converts the wildcard expression $wc into a regular expression according
    to the options stored into the Regexp::Wildcards object, or to $type if
    it's supplied. It successively escapes all unprotected regexp special
    characters that doesn't hold any meaning for wildcards, then replace
    'jokers' or 'sql' and 'commas' or 'brackets' (depending on the "do" or
    "type" options), all of this by applying the 'capture' rules specified
    in the constructor or by "capture".

EXPORT
    An object module shouldn't export any function, and so does this one.

DEPENDENCIES
    Carp (core module since perl 5), Text::Balanced (since 5.7.3).

CAVEATS
    This module does not implement the strange behaviours of Windows shell
    that result from the special handling of the three last characters (for
    the file extension). For example, Windows XP shell matches *a like
    ".*a", "*a?" like ".*a.?", "*a??" like ".*a.{0,2}" and so on.
